# Reminder Timer
 Simple Timer used to remind me to take a break while I am working at my desk after every hour using Python and various libraries.

 ## Description
Using **Python, Tkinter, Pygame, and the Time module** this timer has two simple buttons, "start" and "reset," which are used to initiate a timer that sets off an alarm and message one hour after started. 
The goal here was to create a simple project to practice using various basic coding concepts and Python libraries. Design and appearance was not a heavy focus for this small project. The goal was to just create something readable and easy to implement.

## Langauges/Libraries Used:
* Python
* Tkinter and Tkinter.ttk
* Python Time module
* Pygame (to incorporate sound)

## Planned Updates:
Currently the only update planned is to add a feature that will allow the user to input when they would like to have the alarm go off, instead of just having it set to the locked in hour that it is currently set to.
